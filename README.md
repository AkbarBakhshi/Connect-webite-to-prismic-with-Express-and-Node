Download or clone the project on your local drive. Open Terminal (Command prompt) and navigate to the project folder. Then run ```npm install```. You should see a new folder called **node_modules** in the project folder.

During **Development**, from the terminal, inside the project folder, run ``` npm start``` command to start the server. You should see a new folder called **public** in the project folder with compiled css, javascript and all the files in the static folder. You now can visit ***localhost:3000*** in your browser to access the home page.

For **Production**, make sure to run ``` npm frontend:prod``` command inside the project folder.
